        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nothing beats an easy to make and even easier to prepare roast chicken! Especially when roasted with garlic butter, rosemary, parsley, lemon, and a hint of white wine for an unbeatable flavour. This Garlic Herb Butter Roast Chicken definitely beats the pants off of any rotisserie chicken!</p>
        <p>When we roast chicken, we don’t do it with just a sprinkling of salt. No no no…we do it FLAVOUR. There is so much of it in this chicken that beats any restaurant chicken.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Garlic + Butter = Garlic Butter</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>A touch of lemon</li>
            <li>A hint of dry white wine (optional, but adds so much flavour to the meat while keeping it so juicy)</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
    
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven.</li>
            <li>Rinse and pat dry chicken with paper towel.</li>
            <li>Combine olive oil, melted butter, wine (if using) and lemon juice together, rubbing all over the chicken, under the skin and inside the cavity.</li>
            <li>Season chicken outside and inside with salt, pepper and parsley. Don’t be afraid to use generous amounts!</li>
            <li>Rub the minced garlic over the chicken and under the skin. I do this separately as the last step to maximise the garlic taste.</li>
            <li>Stuff the garlic head into the chicken cavity along with the rosemary sprigs and the squeezed lemon halve. You can also use sprigs of Thyme or any other herb.</li>
            <li>Roast chicken, basting half way through cooking time, until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Broil until golden and crispy!</li>
        </ol>
